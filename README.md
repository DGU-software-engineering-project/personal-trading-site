user stories

1. As a user who owns some products, I want to sign up, sign in and sign out, so that I can manage my products in the web site.
2. As a user, everyone can see all the products posted in the web site, so that users don’t need to sign in to see products.
3. As a signed user, I want to upload a product information including textual description, some photos and keywords, so that everyone can see my products in the website.
4. As a user who owns some products in the website, I want to modify my product information after I posted my product, so that I can manage my products in the website.
5. As a user who owns some products in the website, I want to mark the product as “sold” when the product is sold, so that everyone knows that the item has been sold.
